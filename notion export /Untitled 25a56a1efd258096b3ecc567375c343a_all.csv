Her mother created a unique fusion of Maharashtra and Mysore cooking styles. At 15, Sandhya started practicing Ashtanga yoga with the legendary Sri K. Pattabhi Jois to cure health issues, continuing until she married at 22. After her husband passed away, she found her calling and opened her home restaurant in 1998. She combined her guru's yogic teachings, her grandfather's Ayurvedic knowledge, generations-old family recipes, and adjustments for Western palates to create legendary ""sattvic"" meals. Her very first meal got a standing ovation from the people who enjoyed her cooking. The restaurant still operates from her home. She became internationally famous among yoga practitioners worldwide who come to practice in Mysore. She even publihed a cook book -  ""Mysore Style Cooking”.The book includes over 60 traditional recipes with personal stories and images of life in Mysore.

Totally different from any other dosa you’ve ever had anywhere in the world. After she passed, her two grandsons inherited the business, but like typical family drama, the brothers couldn't get along and split up. One brother kept the original ""Hotel Mylari"" and the other opened ""Original Vinayaka Mylari"" right across the street serving identical dosas from ajji's recipe! Then things got interesting when this third place ""Mylari Agrahara"" opened near the Palace, and nobody knows the real story - some say it's a distant family member, others think it's one of the cooks from the Nazarbad places who learned the recipe and started his own joint. The guy serves exactly the same dosas though, so whoever he is, he definitely knows the secret! Now about these dosas - they're nothing like the crispy ones you get elsewhere. These are soft, almost spongy, light brown colored, and they literally melt in your mouth like butter. Instead of potato masala, they have sagu - that's green chili-coriander paste with finely chopped onions - and they slap a huge dollop of white benne served with fresh coconut chutney. One bite you'll understand why people have been fighting over the ""original"" recipe for decades. Over the years, lots of big shots have made pilgrimages here - you'll see photos on the walls of cricketers like Rahul Dravid and Anil Kumble who've stopped by, and it was legendary Dr. Rajkumar's favorite dosa place.

","Sri Chamarajendra Zoological Gardens, established in 1892 by Sri Chamarajendra Wodeyar Bahadur as ""Khas-Bangale"" as a modest 10.9-acre private royal zoo attached to the summer palace next to it. He appointed German botanist Gustav Hermann Krumbeigel (who also designed Bengaluru's Lalbagh) to design it. In 1907 an additional 6.22 acres was included and  subsequently was expanded to 45 acres. The first and prominent superintendent was A.C. Hughes (from South Wales), who served from 1892–1924. Together with Sir Mirza Ismail and G.H. Krumbiegel, the zoo was modernized with innovative, naturalistic enclosures. The original animal enclosures were carved out of the Summer Palace gardens and designed to be spacious, with a strong emphasis on the comfort and well-being of the animals, veryunusual for that era. Currently is spreads over acres including the 77.02-acre Karanji Lake. The Maharaja's personal collecting expeditions to Europe and Africa brought exotic species like giraffes, ape, polar bear, penguins etc. The zoo's management transitioned through various governmental bodies - initially under royal patronage, then managed at various times by the Horticulture Department, the Department of Parks and Gardens, and later the Forest Department. Administrative control eventually transferred to the Zoo Authority of Karnataka in 1979, making it the first such autonomous zoo management body in the country. Mysore Zoo earned worldwide acclaim for achieving the world's first caesarian section delivery performed on an elephant, bringing it international recognition in veterinary science. The institution also holds the Guinness World Record through its Shuka Vana for housing over 2,000 bird species in a single aviary. 
The zoo houses many special animals like the white tiger (who is an icon) and it was home to Polo, the only gorilla in the country for a long time. There is a good story here - Polo, a Western Lowland Gorilla born in 1972 at Dublin Zoo, Ireland, became one of Mysore Zoo's most beloved and iconic residents after arriving on August 8, 1995, to join female gorilla Sumathi. After Sumathi's death in 2001 from cardiac arrest, Polo lived alone for the rest of his life. He was bilingual—responding to commands in both English and Kannada. He has a best friends Wali, a chimpanzee. Zoo authorities made repeated efforts to find him a girlfriend, even reaching out to international zoos, but were unsuccessful. Polo outlived the average gorilla lifespan of 35 years, surviving to 43, making him one of the oldest in captivity in India. In his final month, Polo suffered from respiratory problems, reduced appetite, and lethargy. He died in April 2014 after a period of declining health, and was buried next to his longtime friend Wali, a chimpanzee. The zoo maintains India's largest elephant population with 10 current residents among 34 total elephants that have lived there. The 1,450-specimen sanctuary represents 168+ species from 25+ countries. Five acres were dedicated to the Natural History Museum, significantly enhancing its educational role in wildlife awareness. The zoo launched comprehensive animal adoption and rescue schemes, including the notable Koorghalli Rescue program, furthering its mission in conservation, education, and animal welfare. "

Back between 1645-1648, King Kanteerava Narasimharaja Wadiyar built a dam (embankment) across the Kaveri River. Nobody planned on creating a bird sanctuary. The dam just created these islands, and birds decided ""hey, this looks nice"" and started nesting. Originally there were 25 islets - now only 6 remain. The real hero of Ranganathittu is Dr. Salim Ali - India's ""Birdman."" In 1939-40, he surveyed the area and was blown away by what he saw. He literally convinced the Maharaja of Mysore (Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV) to declare it a protected sanctuary on July 1st, 1940. Without Salim Ali's persistence, this could've just been another stretch of river with some birds. They also call it ‘Pakshi (bird in Kannada) Kashi’ as in its like Kashi for avian life. The sanctuary is named after Sri Ranganatha Swamy Temple nearby.  Ranganathittu has the largest freshwater crocodile population in Karnataka. These are Mugger crocodiles (Marsh crocodiles), and there are 80-100 of them lounging around the islands. Growing in the sanctuary is Iphigenia mysorensis - an endemic and threatened lily species from the Colchicaceae family. Ranganathittu is home to roughly 170 recorded bird species, and during peak winter season (mid-December through February), this place transforms into an absolute avian carnival with up to 40,000 birds packed onto these tiny islands. The regulars who breed here year-round include Painted Storks, Asian Openbill Storks, Black-headed Ibis, Spot-billed Pelicans, Oriental Darters, Cormorants, and various Egrets and Herons. But the real magic happens when the winter migrants arrive from halfway across the world - birds flying in from Siberia, Latin America, North America, and Australia to nest and breed in this little pocket of Mysore. Over 30 species of migratory birds show up between January and February, treating the sanctuary like their annual vacation home. About 50 Spot-billed Pelicans have gotten so comfortable here they've just decided to stay permanently - and good for them, because these guys are ""Near Threatened"" globally and Ranganathittu is actually helping their population recover."
"KRS Dam ","I like the dam a lot but I don’t like the garden as much because its too crowded and people litter.

Don;t visit during the summer when the kids have holidays its gets super crowded. ",Around the city,"I think its a ₹100 + toll. Take cash. ","6:30 AM to 9:00 PM ","KRS Dam exists because of a tragedy. In 1875-76, a brutal drought wiped out one-fifth of the population of the Kingdom of Mysore. Crop failures were constant, and people were migrating away from Mysore and Mandya districts every hot summer. The Kaveri River was identified as a potential source of irrigation water for the region. Chief Engineer Sir M. Visvesvaraya, also known as the ""Father of Modern Mysore"" , proposed building a dam across the river near Kannambadi village to provide irrigation, drinking water, and power supply to the Shivanasamudra hydroelectric station. The Finance Ministry of Mysore opposed the project, claiming it would ""serve no purpose"" and that electricity demand was insufficient. Visvesvaraya approached Diwan T. Ananda Rao and Maharaja Krishna Raja Wadiyar IV. On October 11, 1911, the Maharaja approved the project and allocated ₹81 lakhs for construction. The Madras Presidency opposed the project and urged the imperial government to reject it, but Visvesvaraya's persuasion succeeded. Krishna Raja Wadiyar IV laid the foundation stone. Construction began with 10,000 workers employed. The dam was built using surki mortar (a mixture of lime and brick powder) instead of cement, as cement was not manufactured in India and importing would be costly. The structure measured 2,621 meters (8,600 feet) in length and 130.80 feet in height above the riverbed. Sir M. Visvesvaraya installed 48 automated crest gates in 6 sets - the first dam in the world to feature such technology. Dewan Sir Mirza Ismail planned and built Brindavan Gardens at the dam site, inspired by Kashmir's Shalimar Gardens and designed in Mughal style. German botanist Gustav Hermann Krumbiegel (who designed the mysore zoo gardens and lalbhag in bangalore) designed the 60-acre terraced garden with fountains, lawns, and flower beds. The dam was completed between 1931-1932 at a total cost of ₹2.5 crore. The Kannambadi village and Kanveshvara Temple were submerged when the reservoir filled.  The Krishna Raja Sagara Dam was inaugurated with a capacity of 49.45 TMC feet at maximum water level of 124.80 feet. The dam began supplying water for irrigation to Mysore and Mandya districts, drinking water to Mysore city, and power to Shivanasamudra hydroelectric station. Water supply from KRS was gradually extended. The dam became the main drinking water source for Mysore, Mandya, and eventually most of Bangalore city. Water released from KRS began flowing to Tamil Nadu, stored in Mettur Dam (we fight about this a lot). "

The foundation was commissioned on November 18, 1921, and construction was completed in 1930. The palace was designed by renowned architect Edwin Wolleston Fritchley from Bombay in Renaissance architectural style, with its design inspired by St. Paul's Cathedral in London, particularly the central dome, while also reflecting English manor houses and Italian palazzos. This magnificent two-storied white structure features Ionic double columns, spherical domes, and a dominating central dome. The interiors are breathtaking, with Italian marble floors and staircases, Belgian crystal chandeliers, Persian carpets, cut glass lamps, heavy ornate furniture, and decorative stained glass throughout.

Vivekananda initially stayed at the Niranjan Mutt (Anathalaya) on Narayana Sastri Road, which was located adjacent to the Dewan's house. The Maharaja was so delighted that he insisted Vivekananda stay in the palace itself, where he had extensive discussions on Vedanta with pundits, an Austrian musician, and the Maharaja. Crucially, it was during his stay in Mysore that Vivekananda first decided to participate in the World Parliament of Religions in Chicago in 1893, and the Maharaja readily offered to fund his travel expenses.

The temple is dedicated to Lord Vishnu in his form as Venugopala, which translates to 'the flute player,' depicting Lord Vishnu as Krishna playing his iconic flute. Before the Krishna Raja Sagara dam project was conceived by M. Visvesvarayya in 1909, the temple complex was located in the village of Kannambadi. The KRS Dam project meant that Kannambadi and other surrounding settlements would be submerged. The original temple complex was massive, with an area of around 50 acres, measuring 100 by 60 yards. The then king of Mysore, Krishna Raja Wadiyar IV ordered the construction of a new village for the residents of Kannambadi and named it Hosa Kannambadi (New Kannambadi). However, the Venugopala Swamy temple complex and 2 other temples namely Kenneshwara (Ishwara) temple and Kalamma Temple had to be abandoned. By 1930, the first phase of the dam was completed and all three temples were submerged. For more than 70 years the temple lay underwater, when the Khoday Foundation took up the task of relocating and restoring the temple. The in-house architects of the group had shot the original temple on video, taken over 16,000 photographs, and marked each and every slab used in the construction of the original temple. Each and every stone was marked and numbered. They engaged masons, trained artisans and sculptors with half a dozen experts from Tamil Nadu for rebuilding the temple at Hosa Kannambadi. Damaged and missing idols were remade and replaced. The cost of the project was estimated to be around ₹2.5 crore. The new site is about one km to the north of the original site. When the KRS dam is full, the water lashes against the temple's walls on all three sides. "

Many films and TV shows were shot here.The building was used as a private residence until it was converted into a hotel, called ""Green Hotel"" in the 1970s. In 1990 during the shooting of the television drama ""The Sword of Tipu Sultan"" directed by Sanjay Khan and Akbar Khan, a major fire accident burnt down the Palace, and claimed 62 lives. A woman called Hilary Blume decided to turn it into a hotel that gave all the profits to charity. They give money to a variety of charities like the Rural Health and Literacy Program. All profits are distributed to charitable and environmental projects in India. The hotel has been set up as a model of sustainable tourism, by the Charities Advisory Trust, a UK charity.

Jayalakshmi Vilas Mansion has 125 rooms, 300 windows, and 287 ornate doors spread across 6 acres. Its layout consists of three wings and includes distinctive spaces like a dancing hall (Kalyana Mantapa), residential suites, and a stained-glass dome.

",8:30 am–5 pm," It's one of the oldest modern buildings in Mysore, over 160 years old now. Construction started in 1856 and finished in 1861. It was built by Krishnaraja Wodeyar III as a backup palace for the royal family.

The main Mysore Palace was being renovated and rebuilt at various points, so the royals needed somewhere else to stay. Jaganmohan Palace was meant to be that alternate home—a place where the king and his family could live when the main palace was under construction.

In 1896, during Princess Jayalakshmanni's wedding celebrations, the old wooden Mysore Palace caught fire and got seriously damaged. The decision was made to demolish it completely and build a new one. Construction on the new Mysore Palace started in 1897 and took until 1912 to complete.
During those 15 years, Jaganmohan Palace became the main royal residence. Major events happened here—the king held his daily court, special Dasara ceremonies, and even his coronation in 1902 (with Lord Curzon, the Governor-General of India, attending).

Once the new Mysore Palace was finished in 1912, the royal family moved back. But Jaganmohan Palace continued to be used for royal ceremonies and events. In 1915, it was converted into an art gallery. In 1955, it was officially renamed the Sri Jayachamarajendra Art Gallery in honor of one of the last ruling maharajas.

It's an art museum with over many paintings including the works by famous Indian artists like Raja Ravi Varma, plus paintings from Mughal, Shantiniketan, and other Western styles. They also have sculptures, weapons, antique coins, musical instruments, and all kinds of royal artifacts. There's even a famous painting called ""Lady with the Lamp"" that gets its own special room.

Graham Greene was his mentor and helped him publish some of his early work. Malgudi, his most famous creation, was inspired by places in Mysore and Chennai. He drove a Mercedes-Benz in Mysore, an unusual luxury for mid-20th-century India, after literary success. He famously said Mysore was ideal for writers because of its “integrity, peace, and simplicity”. His was restored and opened to the public as a museum that displays memorabilia, original manuscripts, photographs, his personal library, and period furnishings."

This Cathedral is patterned after St. Patrick’s Cathedral of New York and is a replica of the Cathedral in Cologne in Germany. The Church is built in a Cross Shape. From the aerial view the Church looks a huge Cross embedded on the earth. The total height from the tip of the cross to the base is 187 feet, making it one of the tallest buildings in the city. The “Twin crosses” of 16 feet could be seen from miles around. The “Twin Towers”, Contain “Three Bells”. The three bells in the twin towers of the cathedral are rung in unison on festive days and on special occasions.  

Earlier it was a small chapel for the British Catholic Workers. There were a lot of Catholic workers who came to work in Mysore especially in Railways, Constructions and many other jobs.  This first Chapel was built by Rev. Fr. Etienna Louis Charbonnoux, the then parish priest of St. Joseph’s Church, with the donation given by the Maharaja of Mysore and generous devotees. His Highness, Maharaja Krishnaraja Wodeyar III on 1st January 1843 laid the foundation stone. In 1927, during the years Mr. T. Thumboo Chetty, the Huzar Secretary to His Highness, the Maharaja of Mysore, obtained the statue and relic of the saint from Rome. He also obtained the “Holy Oil” from Rome and handed it over to the parish priest. Rev. Fr. Rene Jean Feuga (1931-1964), the parish priest planned a new Church, because the congregation was rapidly growing in number and a large Church would answer all his problems and it will also be worthy of the beautiful city of Mysore. So, he demolished the old Church in the year 1939 and dedicated the new Church to St. Philomena. The foundation stone for the New Church was laid on 28th October 1933 by His Highness Nalwadi Sri Krishnarajendra Wadiyar Bahadur IV. "

Go before the crowd gets there.,Around the city,,10 am–5:30 pm,"The Mysore Palace, also called Amba Vilas Palace, is Karnataka's crown jewel and India's second most visited monument after the Taj Mahal, pulling in over 6 million visitors every year. Sitting right in the heart of Mysore city facing the Chamundi Hills to the east, this palace has been the official residence of the Wodeyar dynasty for nearly 600 years. 

The palace standing today is actually the fourth one built on this site. The Wodeyars established their first palace here back in the 14th century around 1399, when Yaduraya Wodeyar founded the dynasty. That original structure was built as part of a wooden fortress in what locals call the ""Old Fort"" area, originally known as ""puragiri"" (literally meaning citadel). The earliest recorded mention of a palace on this site dates to 1638.
The palace has had a dramatic history of destruction and rebirth:
• 1638: Lightning strike destroyed the palace. Rebuilt by Kantirava Narasa Raja Wodeyar (1638-1659), who extended it with new pavilions.
• 1793: Tipu Sultan, the maverick son of Hyder Ali who seized power from the Wodeyars, demolished the palace completely. The Wodeyars had lost control of Mysore during turbulent times.
• 1799: When Tipu Sultan died, 5-year-old Krishnaraja Wodeyar III reclaimed the throne. His coronation happened under a temporary marquee tent because there was no palace! He quickly commissioned a new palace in Hindu architectural style, completed in 1803.
• 1897: THE BIG FIRE - This hastily-built wooden palace caught fire during the wedding celebrations of Princess Jayalakshammanni, the eldest sister of Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV. The entire structure was razed to the ground.

The Current Palace (1897-1912):
After the devastating 1897 fire, Queen Regent Maharani Kempananjammanni Vanivilasa Sannidhana (mother of the young king Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV, who was still a minor) took charge. She commissioned the famous British architect Henry Irwin to design a palace that would be a lasting tribute to Mysore's glory.
The construction took 15 years (1897-1912) and cost Rs. 41,47,913 (approximately $30 million adjusted for inflation). The work was overseen by B.P. Raghavulu Naidu, an executive engineer who studied architecture in Delhi, Madras, and Calcutta to plan this masterpiece. The palace was further expanded around 1930-1940 during the reign of Jayachamaraja Wodeyar, the 25th and last ruling Maharaja of Mysore. 

The palace is a stunning three-story gray granite structure with pink marble domes, crowned by a five-story tower that's 145 feet tall. The palace measures 245 feet in length and 156 feet in width. The architectural style is Indo-Saracenic - a magnificent blend of:
• Hindu temple architecture
• Mughal domes and arches
• Rajput pavilions
• Gothic Revival elements
• Neo-Classical touches
At the main entrance, there are bronze tigers sculpted by British artist Robert William Colton flanking the walkways. The central arch features a sculpture of Gajalakshmi (goddess of prosperity) with her elephants, blessing the palace with wealth and prosperity.
The palace has THREE entrances:
1. East Gate (Jaya Maarthaanda) - Opens only during Dasara for VVIPs
2. South Gate (Balarama) - For the general public
3. West Gate (Varaha) - Opens during Dasara celebrations

The kingdom's motto is inscribed in Sanskrit on the entrance gate: ""न बिभॆति कदाचन"" (""Never be terrified""). 

The palace cellar contains several secret tunnels that lead to Srirangapatna (about 15 km away), other palaces, Chamundi Hills, and various confidential locations. These escape routes were built during the Wodeyar reign for emergencies and wartime strategies. 

KEY ROOMS AND HALLS
1. GOMBE THOTTI:
The entrance pavilion originally displayed dolls during Dasara festivities - a tradition inherited from Vijayanagar times where every house arranges dolls during the festival. Today it houses European marble sculptures and art objects. The northern bay contains the famous Golden Howdah (Ambari) covered with 80 kg of gold sheets.
2. ANE BAGILU:
The main entrance symbolizing power and strength.
3. AMBA VILAS (Private Hall):
A luxurious hall with doors carved from rosewood where the king held private meetings with ministers.
4. DURBAR HALL:
A 155-foot-high hall with ornate ceilings, sculpted pillars, and harmonious green-gold color schemes. The ceiling features fine stucco art portraying Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva surrounded by the twelve zodiac signs. A chandelier imported from Persia hangs here. This is where the Golden Throne is displayed during Dasara.
5. KALYANA MANTAPA:
An octagonal hall where all royal weddings, birthdays, and ceremonial functions were celebrated. 
• Stained-glass ceiling with peacock motifs and floral mandalas designed by Mysore artists but manufactured in Glasgow, Scotland
• Glazed tile flooring with peacock designs made in England
• Cast iron dome supported by clusters of pillars
• 26 paintings depicting the Dasara procession
• Hanging chandelier from the central dome

6. PAINTINGS GALLERY:
Between 1934 and 1945, the Wodeyars commissioned five of Karnataka's finest artists to paint the glory and grandeur of the Mysore Dasara Procession. 26 panels based on actual photographs were created and are displayed here, showing scenes like the procession passing St. Philomena's Cathedral, white oxen pulling wagons adorned with the ganda bherunda (two-headed eagle - the royal insignia), crowds lining streets, and more.

7. PORTRAIT GALLERY:
Contains valuable paintings and photographs of the royal family, including:
• Two portraits of the one-year-old prince Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV by Raja Ravi Varma - considered national treasures
• Two large portraits of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra by English artist Harold Speed
• A miniature of Krishnaraja Wodeyar III in watercolor and gold
• Oil on canvas of Yuvaraja Narasimharaja Wodeyar by Felix Wecksler
• 19th-century photographs, including a large portrait of Krishnaraja Wodeyar III by palace photographer R. Vasu

Raja Ravi Varma (1848-1906) was commissioned by Maharaja Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV to paint mythological paintings for the Durbar Hall. Originally, nine paintings with ""Puranic"" (mythological) themes were intended for the rear wall of the Public Durbar Hall. These included scenes from the Ramayana and Mahabharata like ""Rama Breaking the Sacred Bow of Siva,"" ""Jatayu Vadha,"" and others. However, these paintings were later relocated to the Jaganmohan Palace Art Gallery. 

One of the most magnificent pieces of royal regalia in India, the Golden Throne is the stuff of legends. 
The throne weighs 280 kg, though the core structure is made of figwood (not solid gold). It's covered with sheets of gold and precious stones. Its over 800 years old. According to Sanskrit inscriptions on the royal umbrella, the throne has been passed down through generations of Wodeyar kings. Legend says it originally belonged to Dharmaraja Yudhishthira, the eldest Pandava brother from the Mahabharata. On top sits a celestial bird called Huma (a swan with an emerald gem on its beak). Legend says whoever the shadow of this bird falls upon will always wear the royal crown. The umbrella has 24 slokas (verses) in Sanskrit inscribed on the rim, addressed to Krishnaraja Wodeyar III, blessing him as ""Lord of the Earth"" and ""Lord of the Karnataka Ratna Simhasana."" The throne is displayed to the public ONLY during the 10 days of Dasara/Navarathri. The rest of the year, it's disassembled into 8 parts and kept locked in a high-security strong room. 

Chinnada Ambari is a magnificent 750-kg wooden structure crafted from fig and audumbar wood, covered with approximately 80-85 kg of filigreed gold sheets featuring intricate designs of scrolls, foliage, and flowers. Created by master goldsmith ""Swarnakala Nipuna"" Singannacharya over a century ago during or before the reign of Maharaja Krishnaraja Wadiyar IV (1895-1940), who later added further gold decorations, this masterpiece has two wide seats where the king once sat with his brother and nephew during processions. The structure features three carved pillars on each side, a crown-like canopy topped with five sacred Kalashas, a silver seat with embellishments, two ivory fly whisks tipped with gold and silver zari, and battery-operated red and green lights that the king used to control the procession pace - red to stop (so people could offer flowers which the elephant would lift to the king), and green to continue. While the tradition of using howdahs in Dasara processions dates back to the Vijayanagar Empire and was evolved during Krishnaraja Wadiyar III's reign (replacing earlier chariot processions), this specific golden howdah served the Maharajas during Dasara and royal birthday celebrations until Jayachamaraja Wadiyar became the last royal to ride it in 1969. After the abolition of monarchy and privy purses in 1971, the tradition changed to carrying the idol of Goddess Chamundeshwari instead. The howdah is carried during the 5.5 km Jamboo Savari procession from Mysore Palace to Bannimantap by specially trained elephants - first Drona (until 1998), then Balarama for 13 years, followed by Arjuna for 9 years until his death in December 2023, and currently by 54-year-old Abhimanyu. These elephants train for years, first carrying soft cushions, then sand bags, then a 280-kg wooden replica before finally carrying the actual golden howdah, all while being fed a special high-calorie diet. When not in use during Dasara, the howdah is housed in the Gombe Thotti under the custodianship of the Wadiyar family.

There are 12 temples within the palace compound, with construction dates ranging from the 1950s back to the 14th century:
1. Sri Lakshmiramana Swami Temple - One of the oldest temples in Mysore, located on the western part of the fort
2. Sri Shweta Varahaswamy Temple - Built in the famous Hoysala Empire style, located beside the south gate
3. Sri Trinayaneshvara Swami Temple - Ancient temple outside the original fort on the bank of Devaraya Sagar (Doddakere)
4. Sri Prasanna Krishnaswami Temple - Started in 1825 by Krishnaraja Wodeyar III (completed 1829) because he was sad there was no Krishna temple despite the dynasty claiming descent from the Yadu race of Lord Krishna


The palace is illuminated with 97,000 to 100,000 electric light bulbs every Sunday, public holidays, and during all 10 days of Dasara from 7 PM to 10 PM. When this was first done in 1912, most people didn't even have electricity - imagine how mind-blowing it must have been! Over Rs. 1 crore is spent annually just on maintenance, and 25,000+ bulbs are replaced every year before Dasara.

The curse: 
In 1612 (some say 1610), Raja Wodeyar betrayed and overthrew Tirumalaraja, the ruler of Mysore who was connected to the declining Vijayanagar Empire. Alamelamma was Tirumalaraja's widow. When Raja Wodeyar's men came to seize her precious jewels (especially the famous Sriranga Patna jewels), she ran to a cliff overlooking the Kaveri river near Talakadu and before jumping to her death, she cursed:
""May Talakadu become a barren land, may Malangi turn into a whirlpool, and may the Mysore kings never beget children.""

The Curse Manifestation:
For 400 years, this curse seemed very real:
• Talakadu (Talakad) - once a flourishing town - lies buried under sand even today
• Malangi village in Mysore district is slowly eroding due to whirlpools in the river
• The Wodeyar dynasty suffered childlessness in alternate generations, requiring adoption of heirs
Even today, most parts of Talakadu are buried under sand, and the royal family has required adoptions. The last king Srikanta Wadiyar died in 2013 without biological heirs, so Yaduveer Krishnadatta Chamaraja Wodiyar was adopted in 2015.

Curse Broken?
In 2017, a baby boy was born to the royal family, leading to widespread news coverage claiming the 400-year curse was finally broken!

The dungeon measures 30.5 meters by 12.2 meters and is built of brick and lime mortar, featuring a series of symmetrical arches resting on huge pillars that divide the interior into bays - architecturally striking with bulbous arch shapes that integrate with the ceiling, allowing prisoners to stand to full height. It was used by both Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan between 1761 and 1799 to imprison British officers captured during the Anglo-Mysore Wars, most notably after the devastating Battle of Pollilur in 1780. The dungeon gets its name from Colonel William Bailey (also spelled Baillie), who was captured at Pollilur and died here on November 13, 1782, after enduring several months of brutal conditions - he was the only British officer to die in captivity at this location. During the 1799 siege of Srirangapatna when the British bombarded the fort, a large cannon pierced through the strong roof and fell into the dungeon, creating a hole that's still visible today."
Wellesley's Hale Bridge,Good view when the river fills up.,,https://maps.app.goo.gl/u1CADYuZVmFH7Tov8,,,"Around the city, View points",,,"Wellesley Bridge is an ancient stone bridge built across the northern branch of the Cauvery River in Srirangapatna, constructed between August 1802 and October 1804 at a cost of Rs. 5.5 lakhs (equivalent to around Rs. 5½ lakhs in some records). After Tipu Sultan's death in 1799 during the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War, the Kingdom of Mysore was restored to the Wodeyar dynasty with the young Mummadi Krishnaraja Wodeyar III as ruler, and his Dewan-Regent Purnaiah was directed by the king to build a strong bridge across the Cauvery on priority to open up easy communication to Srirangapatna, which was still the capital before it shifted to Mysore city. The site for the bridge was selected by Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington (the governor of Seringapatam and Mysore who led the British forces against Tipu Sultan in 1799), and the bridge was named after his brother Richard Wellesley, who was the Governor-General of British India at the time - a bilingual inscription in English and Persian on the bridge calls it ""Jisr-i-Wellesley"" and records that it was dedicated to ""Richard Marquess Wellesley K.P. Governor General of India by Krishnaraja Wodeyar Bahadur"" as a token of gratitude for benefits conferred on the people of Mysore. The bridge is an interesting specimen of native architecture built to traditional design, composed of monolithic stone pillars mounted with stone corbels (in two layers) that support four layers of stone girders topped by stone slabs forming the roadway, with some stones featuring beautiful carvings interspersed between plain ones. It has 64 spans of 8 feet each with 512 feet of linear waterway, and in Kannada is called ""Kirangur Sethuve"" (meaning ""the bridge that leads to Kirangur village""). Though rough in construction, this engineering marvel has survived over 200 years of the heaviest floods and heavy traffic, withstanding releases of more than 100,000 cusecs of water from the upstream KRS dam during intense monsoons.

"Tipu Sultan Death Place ",,," https://maps.app.goo.gl/qAwLYkSTdHhYBRFn7",,,Around the city,,,"Tipu Sultan, also known as ""Tiger of Mysore,"" died on May 4, 1799, during the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War when British forces besieged and captured his island-capital of Srirangapatna. The spot where his body was found is marked today by a simple stone tablet installed by Colonel Wellesley to demarcate where the illustrious ruler's mortal remains were discovered. On the day of his death, Tipu Sultan was having lunch when he received news that his commander Syed Gaffur had been killed, and he immediately rose, appointed Mohammed Cassim as Gaffur's replacement, and headed westward along the northern ramparts toward the breach where British forces were attacking. He managed to shoot several British soldiers but was soon forced to retreat eastward as the advancing columns overwhelmed his position - complaining of pain in his leg, he mounted his favorite white mare and rode eastward with a few servants, crossed a ditch, and tried entering through a sally port (now demolished) into the town. According to eyewitness accounts from his servants, a wounded and exhausted Tipu was being carried in a palanquin when a British soldier tried to snatch his jeweled sword belt, and with his remaining strength, Tipu lifted his sword and cut the soldier's knee - in retaliation, another soldier shot Tipu at his temple and he died instantly. The battle was so fierce at the arch where Tipu's body was found that at least 300 more dead soldiers lay there, making it impossible to identify who actually killed him. Major-General Sir David Baird and other British officers discovered Tipu's body several hours later after the capture of Srirangapatna, and according to Lieutenant Richard Bayly of the 12th Regiment and other British officers, they were struck by the bravery with which Tipu fought before breathing his last. There is historical confusion about the exact death spot because two plaques exist about 200 meters apart - one at the current stone marker near the extinct Hoally Gate (supported by most contemporary travelers' accounts from 1804 onwards including Lord Valentia, Dr. Francis Buchanan-Hamilton, and Constance Parsons) and another wall plaque at the Water Gate (Kalale Diddi) that wasn't mentioned in accounts before 1895 and wasn't visible in an 1895 photograph, suggesting it was installed between 1895-1921 based on local tradition rather than historical accuracy. The actual death site near the Hoally Gate was demolished to widen the road by 1804, causing this long-standing confusion. On the next day, Sunday, May 5, 1799, around 5 PM, the British allowed Tipu's body to be buried with full military honors at the Gumbaz mausoleum next to his father Hyder Ali's grave - his body was carried in a procession accompanied by European soldiers of the Grenadier division, with his son Abdul Khaliq as the chief mourner, followed by officials and people, and remarkably, a severe thunderstorm struck Srirangapatna at the exact moment his body was being buried. The site today is simple, marked with a stone tablet surrounded by greenery on the side of the main road from Masjid-e-Ala toward the Water Gate, maintained with a security guard present, and while there isn't much to see, it carries immense historical significance as the place where the Tiger of Mysore made his last stand defending his kingdom against overwhelming odds - a combined force of 60,000 British East India Company soldiers (4,000 Europeans and the rest Indians) against Tipu's mere 30,000 troops."
Tipu Sultan’s Summer palace,"Really good place a picnic. Large garden so kids can play. The muesum is great actually. ",,https://maps.app.goo.gl/7wGopS5PDsGYo4bWA,,,Around the city,,9am - 5pm,"Daria Daulat Bagh, meaning ""Garden of the Wealth of the Sea"" in Persian. Construction was commenced by Tipu's father Hyder Ali in 1778 and completed by Tipu Sultan in 1784 at the height of the Kingdom of Mysore's power, designed as his favorite summer retreat and a place where he conducted administrative affairs and planned strategies to defeat the British forces. The palace is a stunning example of Indo-Saracenic architecture built almost entirely of teakwood - chosen for its durability, resistance to insects, and ability to withstand humidity - showcasing a commendable fusion of Deccani, Persian, Rajput, and local Karnataka architectural styles. The rectangular two-story structure (with a basement) is built on a raised square platform with open corridors along all four sides featuring wooden pillars at the edges of the plinth, while the western and eastern wings have walls and the other two wings have recessed bays with pillars supporting the roof, all designed with cusped arches optimized for ventilation and visual appeal in the subtropical climate. Four inconspicuous staircases are built into the four partition walls that divide the ground floor into four corner rooms with a central audience hall connecting the eastern and western corridors, while the upper floor has a large durbar hall where the Sultan held court, featuring intricate carvings and paintings on walls and ceilings along with a beautiful carved wooden staircase with finely carved railings. The palace's most spectacular feature is the extensive mural paintings covering the pillars, walls, canopies, arches, and corridors. The walls inside are painted with tiger stripes - Tipu's favorite design and emblem. After Tipu Sultan's death in the siege of 1799, the British initially looted the palace taking many valuable artifacts and manuscripts (the original ornately carved doors were removed and are now displayed at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, replaced by present doors made of ebony and decorated with ivory gifted by Lord Dalhousie), then converted it into their administrative office, with the Duke of Wellington (Arthur Wellesley) himself living in the palace after the battle. Post-independence, the palace was handed over to the Archaeological Survey of India and declared a National Monument in 1959, now functioning as a museum displaying Tipu's memorabilia including his clothes, crown, Hyder Ali's silver vessels, war weapons, paintings, coins, rare sketches, block prints of prominent personalities and events, and most notably the famous oil painting ""Storming of Srirangapatnam"" by Sir Robert Ker Porter made in 1800 depicting the final fall of Srirangapatna on May 4, 1799, showing Tipu's men giving stiff resistance with many British officers visible and the palace and mosque minarets in the background. The palace is surrounded by beautiful landscaped gardens (the original cypress garden had different species of flowering trees and plants collected by Tipu from Persia, Ottoman Turkey, Kabul, and French Mauritius) and a small mosque called Masjid-E-Aksa is attached to the complex, testament to the Sultan's religious tolerance."

After Tipu's death during the Siege of Srirangapatna on May 4, 1799, the British allowed him to be buried there with full military honors the next day at 5 PM, with his son Abdul Khaliq as chief mourner and a severe thunderstorm striking during the burial. The structure uses Bijapur-style construction with a large dome placed on a cubical framework, supported by 36 highly polished black granite pillars described as smooth as mirrors, with an east-facing entrance and intricate latticework cut through stone. Inside, the walls are painted with tiger stripes (Tipu's signature), and three black marble tombs sit in the center - Hyder Ali in the middle, his wife to the east, and Tipu (identifiable by tiger-striped cloth) to the west. The original gold and silver carved doors were looted by the British and now sit in London's Victoria & Albert Museum, replaced by ebony doors with ivory decoration gifted by Lord Dalhousie. Over 100 family members are buried in the surrounding gardens, including seven of Tipu's sons, his sisters, daughters, chief generals, and nobles, with most inscriptions in Persian. The mausoleum originally stood in the Lal Bagh (Garden of Rubies), the largest garden in Mysore Kingdom covering one-third of the river island, featuring cypress trees and flowering plants collected from Persia, Ottoman Turkey, Kabul, and French Mauritius, though the British cut down many trees during their 1792 occupation to use as tent poles.

Two major legends explain the hill's significance: one states that a wild elephant named Kari killed four maidens bathing in a lake, prompting Sage Kutsamuni to undertake rigorous penance until Lord Srinivasa brought them back to life, while another legend from the Ramayana says that Sugriva, the monkey king, brought this hill (then called Nilachala) from Tirumala (Thirupathi) to help build the bridge to Lanka to rescue Sita, but local Vishnu devotees pleaded with him to leave it here, which he did.
